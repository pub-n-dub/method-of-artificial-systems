<p align="justify"><font size="+2">Use extreme caution when trying to construct 
  this apparatus. It is very dangerous and should not be attempted by amateurs. 
  It generates a form of power that contains more energy per unit. The subsequent 
  waveform is a combination electron-positron pair that will burn you in you get 
  in its path. During my last experiments in Spring 2004, I burned my left hand 
  pretty good and convinced myself the device should be handled with care. Now 
  it requires analysis...</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2">Tthis project is the result of 10 years of 
  work. I began thinking about wireless power back in 1994 but took four prototypes 
  to discover it could really be done. The device itself is rather simple in design, 
  but complex in theory of operation. This shouldn't take away from the import 
  of the design, it can be manufactured once the behavior of the device is mapped. 
  But some of the large-scale uses are wireless lighting, wireless public trams, 
  wireless energy distribution networks, robotics, radio controlled apparatii 
  and other autonomous technologies.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2">The Model 'F' is a multivarable field generator. 
  It is governed by a second order DE based loosly on the Van der Pol equation. 
  and is constructed from off-the-shelf components which are easily and cheaply 
  acquired. In theory, there are three vectors responsible for signal transmission: 
  the E, M, and H vectors. In Marconian terms (the guy wrongly given credit for 
  the invention of the radio), we only use the E and M vectors to transmit information. 
  In Teslian terms, this method ignores the H vector entirely. We cannot ignore 
  the H vector. What the Model 'F' does is squeeze the E and M vectors leaving 
  the H vector in a quasi-linear state. By doing this, the electrons along the 
  E and M vectors take up a smaller space leaving a void which must be filled 
  with something. This void cannot be empty; it is filled with anti-electrons 
  or positrons which make up the composite waveform. The result is a strongly 
  linear waveform with a nonlinear behavior. It propogates along the H vector 
  and can be tuned to any receiver within the transmitter's band. Tests conducted 
  show that just about any receiver type can be utilized with power transmission 
  around 67% efficientcy. The composite wave is designed to transmit information 
  and power simultaneously.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2">In March 2004, I redesigned Tesla&#8217;s wireless 
  generator patent of 1897. I dubbed it &#8220;Model F Wireless Power Generator&#8221; 
  (Figure 1) as a tribute to Tesla&#8217;s work and its designation &#8216;F&#8217; 
  as one in a long series of prototypes which came before. But the Model F differed 
  significantly from Tesla&#8217;s. Firstly, my device was not nearly the size 
  of the original machine and secondly I altered a part of the design to facilitate 
  the use of an ancillary device, the i-Cybie robot (Figure 4). One significant 
  advantage of being 100 years in the future, I was able to use modern materials 
  to construct the device. I used cheap, off-the-shelf, easily available parts 
  such as plastic storage containers for the spiral coil mounts, wooden dowels 
  for the upward antenna, and scrap circuit cards to mount the components specific 
  to my design. To transmit the power on the board, I used hobby brass which was 
  easy and cheap to obtain from the local train shop. Thinking of the energy as 
  a wavelike flow, I employed brass tubing shielded with aluminum to contain the 
  power away from the receiving coil. In past research I learned that paramagnetic 
  materials were best to delay the synchronization of the electric and magnetic 
  with the inductive components of the wave along the linear time vector. I was 
  thinking of the wave in all three dimensions E, I, and H traveling simultaneously 
  at right angles to each other. In order to manipulate such a wave, I discovered 
  from research with the Model C2 (Figure 3) that if I could change the rate (or 
  relational phase) at which the vector H was transmitted with the other two x 
  two components&#8212;frequency and amplitude x (frequency and amplitude)&#8212;keeping 
  these two locked in phase, they could be compressed along the time vector allowing 
  more power to be transmitted in a smaller space while &#8220;floating&#8221; 
  the inductance potential H in a quasi-linear state. There was an opposing force 
  observed when implementing this design. When compressing the two vectors, opposing 
  force electrons would appear. They assumed the opposite charge in the system, 
  categorized as positrons. These positrons cause in an internal oscillation pattern 
  inside the wave agianst the electrons as their motion keeps them from annihilating 
  each other. This point is where I need to do more research and where the heart 
  of the analysis lies. Hypothetically speaking, however, such a solution suggests 
  there is a method to directly effect the physical state of the wave's geometry 
  like a raw material to fabricate different energy systems.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2"><br>
  Tesla&#8217;s design transmitted power from transmitter (Tx) to receiver (Rx) 
  only. Both systems used rather large spiral coils (around 40cm in diameter) 
  and were too large to be hauled around by the robot. I wrote a series of equations 
  whereby I could use a linear-wound coil mounted on the upward dowel shaft in 
  the center of the spiral in agreement with the operational band of the tuned 
  system. This meant there was a third component of the design; power would travel 
  in the same manner, from spiral A to spiral A&#8217;, but the magnitude of the 
  energy was shifted in phase to the ancillary card onboard the Cybie (Figure 
  5). The operational frequency was set to around 68MHz, the amplitude to 24VAC, 
  which was more than enough power to provide 18VDC (once converted by the card) 
  necessary for the robot&#8217;s operation. Operational threshold as of April 
  2004 is 100VAC.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="+2"> The upward linear coil was wound with careful 
  note as to the direction of the wind so I could wind a twin oppositely in agreement 
  with Tesla&#8217;s spiral design. The twin was mounted onto a card cut to fit 
  inside the Cybie&#8217;s battery compartment. There was enough room to fit components 
  onto the board to do the necessary DC conversion of the incoming signal. For 
  all intrinsic purposes the Cybie was ready for test.<br>

<p align="justify"><font size="+2">This unit is a handbuilt capacitor set to the 
  operational frequency of the device. It took about three weeks to construct 
  the apparatus on my porch in Utah. It caused much dismay in my neighbors when 
  they discovered what I was building. I think they were more confused as to my 
  labors more than anything else. I never bothered explaining the machine to many 
  people, most were unsure of what a wireless power device was much less of the 
  implications. Regardless, the machine functioned as expected and had performance 
  much greater than the equations I had written to describe it. I suspect there 
  is more going on than meets the eye.</font></p>
