<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><strong>Part I: Conceiving 
  the Spiral Wave</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here is some of the work 
  that went into the construction of the 'F2'. The first thing to do was to understand 
  how life exists on this planet. Considering it in hierarchal form:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/coghier.jpg" height="769" width="527"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There is a designation, although 
  arbitrary, of the high, low and elemental minds. Assuming without prejudice 
  that all life has some form of cognition, I was able to generate the above figure. 
  Having a concept of life systems, I was ready to review Tesla's patents and 
  try to duplicate his work in a succinct format.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">First off, here are the patents 
  I used to understand the genius of Tesla's designs:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/723188p5j.jpg" height="623" width="800"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Here is patent <a href="http://www.paradoxtechnologies.org/engineering/F2/00723188.pdf">#723188</a> 
  of 1903. It is an extension of <a href="http://www.paradoxtechnologies.org/engineering/F2/00645576.pdf">#645576</a> of 1897.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">From reading Tesla's 
  writing within the patents and work with the Model 'F', I came to realize the 
  propagation of the wave and its ability to transmit energy was directly dependent 
  upon the container in which the wave was to be utilized, and not a function 
  of the windings. How was the energy to be utilized? Using the <em>I-Cybie</em> 
  constraints, I had already designed a card:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/cybie.jpg" height="286" width="708"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In terms of the Tesla 
  patent, my system would appear:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/RevisedF.jpg" height="536" width="721"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At the bottom of 
  the figure is the deployment of the card within the <em>I-Cybie</em> container.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">There had to be a way 
  to use components I had already constructed in the new model. I had to devise 
  a methodology, or a characteristic equation template, to describe and predict 
  the effects of using the card in the composite transmission system. The first 
  step is to look at the container in which the card is to be inserted. Since, 
  for the purposes of this early analysis, the value of integers in the equation 
  is irrelevant—I am merely trying to generate the equation and proper values 
  can be inserted later. If the space within i-Cybie is 4cm x 2cm x 3cm, I can 
  devise a simple equation to describe the geometry:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-1.jpg" height="34" width="131">(1.1)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Where:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-2.jpg" height="28" width="183"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  Solving this equation the value is 24cm3. We need to calculate the number of 
  non-redundant slices in the container. For this we use the following formula:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-3.jpg" height="100" width="116">(1.2)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  Solving (1.2):</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-4.jpg" height="31" width="172"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  There are 98 non-redundant two-dimensional surfaces in the structure. The next 
  step is to alter (1.1) and multiply the solution by the potential in the following 
  form:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-5.jpg" height="42" width="153">(1.3)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  Where <em>rho </em>is measured in volts and <em>psi </em>is the dimensional 
  value cm2 which for the purposes here, is 1. When solving the equation with 
  <em>rho</em> = 6V and inserting the proper values of Xs, Ys, and Zs, it is discovered 
  that the answer is:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-6.jpg" height="30" width="74"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  How did we come to the solution? The waves contacting the surface interact with 
  the container in two-dimensional planes. The first step is to understand the 
  container, which is a cube, as a series of slices of the cube in two dimensions. 
  The next figure is a composite drawing of the container surface:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-7.jpg" height="414" width="551">(Fig 
  1)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Each of the cubes represents 1cm3. 
  Each of the hued surfaces, or slices, represents 1cm2.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The issue in this analysis is to 
  discern how the slices interact within the composite system; that is, as a function 
  of the incoming transmission planes along each corresponding axis x, y, and 
  z. Conceptually, the best way to visualize this composite system is to see the 
  waves in the following fashion:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-8.jpg" height="200" width="633">(Fig 
  2)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  Figure 2 is a conceptual picture of the planar wave in the wireless power system. 
  The left side of the figure shows the incoming transmission waves, the right 
  side shows the components of the plane. In physical electrical wave terms, the 
  magnitude width represents the M vector, the direction length, the E vector, 
  and the amplitude width represents the H vector. However, I will only be discussing 
  the magnitude width and the direction length. At the present time, while delineating 
  the receiving system container (Fig 1), for purposes of simplicity and understanding 
  what types of equations are necessary, two dimensions will be considered. Amplitude 
  width will be covered later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The next step is to consider how 
  the planar waves would interact with the container structure. In order to accomplish 
  this, we must break down the container structure into a series of slices:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-9.jpg" height="438" width="528">(Fig 
  3)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  Each of the slices in Fig 3 is organized by their orientation to the planar 
  axes. For example, slices oriented along the x axis would absorb energy from 
  the planar wave traveling along the x-direction. The slices are from the top, 
  middle, and bottom of the cubic structure. Slices oriented along the y and z 
  axes would absorb energy from the planar wave traveling along the y and z-directions. 
  The slices are shown accordingly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The solved quantity in 1.3 is only 
  valid on a fixed point. A dynamic representation is required to explore how 
  it functions within the active transmission environment. It should appear as 
  1.4:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-10.jpg" height="52" width="168">(1.4)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  The next step is to think of the slices as matrix quantities to understand how 
  each functions individually and to construct a proper computer model. We want 
  to consider:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-11.jpg" height="165" width="153"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Where each of the matrix quantities—1,0;0,1—are 
  normalization values for the purpose of constructing the equations. Actual values 
  will be interpolated later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><strong>Part II: Understanding the 
  Spiral Wave</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the first section, I covered 
  the conceptual framework for perceiving a spiral wave. It is best when initially 
  thinking of these types of waves to see them as planes. In terms of the actual 
  wave, they travel in planes but their geometry is quite different. Let's begin 
  this discussion by breaking Equation 1.4 into parts and integrating each individually:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-12.jpg" height="50" width="278"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-13.jpg" height="33" width="193"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  We use indefinite integral since the range only provides a finite value within 
  it. We are more interested in the behavior of the integrals. Notice also, we 
  have removed the multiplicative quantity <em>rho</em>/<em>psi</em>, it will 
  be of relevance once the new equation has been generated and the plots understood. 
  Using Maple, we want to see what form the integrands take. For a, b, and c:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-14.jpg" height="158" width="645"></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As expected, each is a parabola. 
  Since we have parabolas, we can try to visualize the system of equations on 
  a polar grid. Beginning in two-dimensions, the equation is written in Maple 
  notation:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#990033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><strong>&gt; 
  plot([18*x^2,16*x^2,x=0..2*Pi],-100..100,-100..100, coords=polar);</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which generates the plot:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-15.jpg" height="288" width="388"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  Which is a spiral not unlike the windings of the transmitting array. This indicates 
  that the equations might be on the right track to properly defining the physical 
  system. We want to reassemble the split equation and add the integrals. Next 
  we can expand the plot into three-dimensions. For the function called “implicitplot”, 
  we employ the new integrands with the solution found in (1.4) and using a stimulus 
  value, <em>rho</em>/<em>phi</em>, of 6 volts. Using the following Maple code:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#990033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><strong>&gt; 
  implicitplot3d(18*x^2+16*y^2+15*z^2=588,x=-10..10,y=-10..10,z=-10..10,coords=cylindrical);</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">we can generate the following plot:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-16.jpg" height="228" width="365"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The above figure is a good picture 
  of how the composite waveform will appear. Inputting different stimulus quantities 
  at the different values in the next figure show the behavior of the wave and 
  demonstrate the amplitude of the general form. The figure compares the values 
  at the lower, mid and upper limit:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-17.jpg" height="260" width="1036"></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><strong>Part III: Applying 
  the Spiral Wave</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The goal of this paper is to utilize 
  the hypothesis explored and to present a method where it can be exported into 
  a usable technology, specifically, powering a mobile robot. I have decided to 
  use an off-the-shelf robot toy called <em>i-Cybie</em> made by SilverLit Electronics. 
  The advantage of using this is 1) availability of cheap parts, 2) ease of disassembly 
  and refitting, and 3) access to a large open-source group who write software 
  and hardware upgrades regularly. I have personally worked with this robot for 
  two years and am quite familiar with its programming and limitations. It has 
  lent itself well to modification and retrofitting of previous wireless power 
  experiments namely, the Model 'F'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Computations presented in this paper 
  so far have been in the pursuit of this goal. To this point, I have written 
  the equations with in mind studying their behavior. At a later point, I was 
  to return to the hypothesis and apply real values. The first thing to consider 
  is the amount of potential the on-board i-Cybie system requires for its operation. 
  The original robot comes with a 800mAh Ni-Cd battery pack mounted in the belly 
  of the robot. At a potential of 14.438 volts at 210mA, the device consumes 3.032W 
  of power.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-18.jpg" height="463" width="595"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  The system is constrained by the size of the compartment. To use the wireless 
  system to power the device, it must fit into the compartment, else the robot 
  will not be able to function unobstructed. The dimensions of the inner compartment, 
  standard battery pack, and Model 'F' receiver card are:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Compartment (A): 
  10.20cm x 6.80cm x 1.80cm<br>
  Battery Pack (B): 9.80cm x 7.10cm x 1.70cm<br>
  'F' Receiver Card (C): 10.10cm x 6.80cm x 1.70cm</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The total area of each are: A—124.848cm3, 
  B—118.286cm3, C—116.756cm3. The number of most value to continue 
  calculations is A, since we are interested in the container space and not necessarily 
  with the components that occupy it. In order to calculate the number of slices, 
  we first generate a graphic of what the structure looks like (in rounded cm 
  for ease of modeling—l=10cm x h=7cm x w=2cm). From experience, rounding 
  the shape doesn't effect the general equation greatly, but altering the scale 
  to mm for accuracy reveals more of the quantum effects of the model which doesn't 
  much help the task at hand—to understand the dynamics of the system and 
  construct a physical model.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-19.jpg" height="500" width="600">(Fig 
  4)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  Consider this problem in terms of the first model, create a chart delineating 
  each of the traveling planes:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-20.jpg" height="103" width="129">(1.7)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  With the visual from Figure 4, we can generate the values to calculate the container. 
  Solving (1.7):</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-21.jpg" height="35" width="203">(1.8)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  There are a total of 524cm2 slices in the container. Deploying (1.4) and the 
  solved quantities:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-22.jpg" height="43" width="280"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-23.jpg" height="31" width="209"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
  Since in (1.4) phi is always 1, we can change the variable to show the potential 
  of the stimulus signal rho(v) in volts. We need to construct a polynomial to 
  plot the different solutions. First, showing the relationship:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-24.jpg" height="43" width="335"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Inserting the quantities from (1.8):</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-25.jpg" height="49" width="385"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Reduces the equation into the polynomial:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-26.jpg" height="35" width="211">(1.9)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We are most interested in the real 
  case when the potential rho(v) is 15 volts, the polynomial takes the form:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-27.jpg" height="29" width="193"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This is the characteristic equation. 
  Plotting with the following Maple code:</font></p>

  implicitplot3d(80*x^2+105*y^2+77*z^2=7680,x=-10..10,y=-10..10,z=-10..10,coords=cylindrical);</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">the plot is generated as:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-28.jpg" height="228" width="365"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Which is identical to the model 
  we constructed.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">Part IV: The Function of 
  the Limit</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the previous section, I successfully 
  demonstrated the mathematics behind the Model 'F' Wireless Power Transmitter. 
  This section will discuss the function of the limit in the characteristic equation. 
  In the last plot, the composite form of power transmission can be seen in its 
  geometric form. Notice though, how the shape is altered by a change in limit. 
  First, the lower limit:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-29.jpg" height="243" width="334"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Next, the upper limit:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-30.jpg" height="212" width="353"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The limit is the range in the characteristic 
  equation (1.9) in each direction x, y, and z, it is that which provides the 
  computational values to transform each into a vector. The general form has the 
  limit inscribed between -10 and 10. By dividing the limit between -10 and 0, 
  0 and 10, we can see the symmetry of the form. One of the conceptions I have 
  devised to describe the spiral wave, during the Model 'F' tests, was to think 
  of the traveling wave in two parts—one half generated by the spiral windings 
  of Tx the other half by the spiral windings of Rx. Here are two plots that have 
  been rotated to show the tuned halves. To the left is the upper limit; to the 
  right, the lower limit:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-31.jpg" height="171" width="444"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> Each half was a piece of a tuned 
  pair which created a conduit whereby power could travel through it and information 
  could be transported on the carrier surface. The value of changing the limit 
  is to understand the convergence point of the waveform, that it is a product 
  of two tuned spiral halves which construct an epicenter and generate the composite 
  form in the container structure accordingly. Experiments with the Maple code 
  show that the form only tangibly exists within the -10 to 10 range. Expanding 
  the lower limit to -15 shows the same form, but it is still constrained in the 
  defined range.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><img src="f2_files/1-32.jpg" height="231" width="348"></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> This shows that the shape is quasi-linear 
  possessing properties linear enough to make the concept valid to generate consumable 
  power for the mobile robot. This also suggests that the waves travel in packets 
  of quantized energy which in the future will provide interesting quantum insights.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">What the form is still remains a 
  mystery. There is a thought that there is an opposing force present in the core, 
  something that has the same properties of the normal form, that allows the outer 
  shell to be manifest. The property of mass is the same but charge or spin differ. 
  This suggests that there might be positrons present in the system. From experiments 
  in August 1999 and April 2004, I discovered large discrepancies when comparing 
  input power to output power. It seemed the behavior of the wave packets are 
  stronger as an output form than the sum of their inputs when thinking in conventional 
  electrical terms. Perhaps these packets are stable in their spin when they are 
  first transmitted, but after an indeterminate time the spin starts to decay 
  and the positrons react with electrons present in the environment causing the 
  release of energy. One major question I had was how can a small-scale 5 volt 
  pulsed input into a coil no larger than 4cm cause large-scale severe weather 
  phenomenon over a distance of 40km? For a long time, I believed my equations 
  were in error but seeing I can repeat the scenario as much as I desire, it maybe 
  lend credence to these thoughts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One of the more interesting 
  thoughts is that this form is somehow alive, or the spark to make something 
  alive in the cognitive sense of the word. I suspect that when this form is introduced 
  into the <a href="http://www.paradoxtechnologies.org/foundation/sentiencealgo/sydran.htm">Boagaphish Compiler</a>, it will 
  give the software the dynamics to make it function.</font></p>
