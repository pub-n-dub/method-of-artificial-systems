\begin_layout Title
The Method of Artificial Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This work is the result of a combination of and crosscorrelation between
 contemplation, research, historical precedents, building and programming.
 It posits three primary concepts: Context awareness as atemporal yet substantiv
e to synthetic homeostasis, choice dilution as a quasi-rigorous epistemology,
 and the ability to categorically reason.
 This document argues strong adaptation mechanisms in artificial entities
 generate viable experimental pathways such that a human can not only comprehend
 machine intelligence but can create the kind of architectures and systems
 that will manifest rudimentary machine consciousness.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take to be the foundational notion of an intellectual position where machines
 are not designed by brute-force to suit ignoble models, rather, as causal
 anthropomorphical life-forms in their own right subject to the same rules
 as other living systems; rules such as energy, learning by exploration,
 and survival.
 A well-defined intention and engineering-principled workspace will inspire
 successively complex machines with advancing ranges of adapted behaviors
 that this document terms 'machine intelligence'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Foundations of machine intelligence are imperative to establish in order
 to facilitate evolution from present-day rudimentary forms into those more
 homeostatic; therefore, a proper architecture of similitude, structures,
 modes, and orchestration needs to be implemented as self-evident baselines
 for generational development of a given artificial system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The living cell is observed to be alive when it exhibits homeostasis; that
 is, an internal concerted effort to keep all onboard systems viable.
 One can capture this complexity by an amagalmation of concepts.

\begin_layout Subsection
Terms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis will deal with loosely-defined concepts nested in objective
 terms such as 'robot', 'machine', 'autonomous', 'synthetic creature' and
 the like to describe heretofore abstractly realized phenomenon that which
 comes so easily for us to recognize when we see it.
 It is one of the goals of this document to establish a set of terms suitable
 and narrowly defined to carry specific and targeted meaning of the abstract
 concepts that will be introduced and explored herein.
 The terms used widely throughout this thesis are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feature: the prominent part or characteristic embedded in both physical
 and abstract components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Entity: a dynamic object that possesses behavior forming an commonly-identifiabl
e form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Robot: I will use this term interchangeably with 'machine', 'autonomous
 entity', and 'synthetic creature' meaning a composite artificial life form
 who may or may not bear resemblance to a humanoid form.
 I do not use it in its original context or in its exact translation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Controller: an entity that insists on particular machine states based on
 an external criteria or paradigm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Orchestration: Cooperation between disparate physical or abstract elements
 resulting in finely-grained coordination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Autonomy: A system defined by its own behavior derived from experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I employ the terms 'life' and 'living' loosely throughout this thesis.
 I will use the terms to mean 'any system constructed or natural that interacts
 directly with a human observer generating interest'.
 Granted the definition is limited and perhaps flawed, it is for the conclusion
 of the research during my dissertation that this will be rectified.
 For now, I don't want to be mired in the metaphysical aspects while just
 beginning the work, hence the abbreviation here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Reluctance of AI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Artificial intelligence requires three basic mathematical components, or
 ingredients, to make it what it is.
 The formal science requires a level of mathematical formulisation in computatio
n, logic, and probability; it wasn't until the appearance of George Boole
 (1815 - 1864) and Gottlob Frege (1848 - 1925) that knowledge representation
 was defined.
 Alfred Tarski (1902 - 1983) introduced a theory of reference showing how
 logical objects could be related to their real-world counterparts.
 Turing, following Godel's incompleteness theorem, demonstrated what kinds
 of functions could be computed, expressed as the Church-Turing thesis.
 However, this introduced a series of intractable problems that would be
 left until the appearance of complexity theory in the 1970s to be shown
 how to compute proper solutions from problem instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The history of artificial intelligence stretches back to the first doctrines
 of logic by Plato and the development of mathematics by luminaries such
 as Archimedes which disappeared until rediscovery in the 18th Century.
 Part of this thesis will reexamine some of the more intractable problems
 in AI such as knowledge representation and choice-motivated decision-making
 by examining them in a geometric light.
 However, this has not been developed far at the time of the writing of
 this document and will be included in future revisions.
 Nevertheless, a comprehensive look of assets and alternatives is due the
 field wherein new theoretical, abstract, and experimental paradigms can
 be generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will take the time to mention here that a series of confessions have bled
 into the media of late.
 One of the more notable was one by Rodney Brooks that caught my attention.
 However, the reluctance of AI can be traced back to the Lighthill Report
 which can be summarized as a critical review of the power of AI professed
 by its earliest proponents in the mid 20th Century.
 The result was that many programs were closed in the University system
 and others were renamed to keep them going.
 However, the shadow of failure seems to still permeate to this day.
 If the recent confessions are an indicator of the validity of the Lighthill
 Report then Brooks' confession of failure

,

\end_inset

 might indeed point to a fundamental flaw in the field that should be identified
 before any further work is conducted–hence why I addresses this issue in
 the first section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't think this is a failure of the individual research in question,
 but is indicative of a more endemic problem buried deep in the field, something
 between those properties discussed at the earliest conferences in the late
 1950s–hosted by von Neumann and expounded by Turing–and how they were manifest
 in technology decades later.
 Norbert Wiener comes to mind who prophesied many types of intelligent machines
 and started a conference track attended by the future founders of cybernetics:
 W.
 Ross Ashby, Grey Walter, and Warren McCulloch.
 However, despite attention given to this field, many works did not persist
 beyond their creators.
 There was, of course, some dissemination of concepts such as homeostasis
 by Ashby and the circuits of Walter's tortoises–specifications of which
 were reexamined in 2003
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

–however, it could not be discovered if their works made their way into
 commercial projects.
 This does not imply that the founders of the field necessarily failed;
 there were some interesting and successful developments in robots for space
 exploration beginning with the Luna Project by the Soviet Union that cumulated
 in the Mars exploratory robots that have shown how robust such a system
 can be made not to mention adaptive to deal with the conditions on a hostile
 planet so far from its source.
 So there have been some shining examples and some catastrophic failures–was
 Big Blue really intelligent? I argue that it wasn't.
 Some applications are simply misguided and I point to the lack of continuity
 in the field; although Wiener's machines were behemoths, Stanford Beer's
 economic and business derivations were sublime.
 Somewhere between creating theory and the delicate operation of putting
 the theory into operation lies a serious rub that can be solved in a myriad
 of ways.
 There must be a way to derive a language framework wherein to eliminate
 trivialities of semantics to unite a field as disparate and wide-reaching
 as cybernetics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what kind of machines will be discussed here? I will focus on a single
 realization, robotics, which will yield three questions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aspect: Robots who are made to be independent, work collectively in sharing
 functions yet relying explicitly on human interaction to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

survive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 socially and to derive purpose, from this,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How do socio-robotic colonies form and what are their structures?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Are there biological analogues that can be modeled and used to the project's
 advantage?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Will there be a socio-collective bond between the intelligent machine and
 its human analogue?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I believe that with the proper time and budgetary requirements, I can fulfill
 the dream of robots closely interacting with humans in our global society.
 I expect then, a direct consequence of this, the porting of technologies
 to human-machine hybrids such as intelligent medical devices, replacing
 biological organs with artificial ones, and custom-tailored enhancements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So why hasn't this already happened? Why don't we see robots around in our
 cities? I argue that the technology is sophisticated enough to make a reasonabl
e facsimile of a humanoid-style machine to behave in a human-like away that
 would be able to interact.
 I say it has already been done in a rudimentary sense within the past five
 years; commercial projects such as those out of iRobot and Sony speak volumes
 about the technology, so what is holding us back intellectually from accomplish
ing it? Is there some unconscious block preventing us from building robots
 such as those depicted in science-fiction?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These 'reluctances' provide insight into knotty problems; from assaying
 the strengths and failures of historical works, I believe the problem can
 be rendered geometrically.
 I will address this later in the thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Words
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not withstanding this general survey, let me now take the time to examine
 most closely the specific inspirational sources for this work and where
 my notion of choice in the machine as a quantifier for true artificial
 life has derived from.
\end_layout

Artificial Intelligence

\begin_layout Standard
I would like to set the scene for this thesis, what has inspired it, and
 where it will be going based on some more detailed sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Living Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I suppose the most unavoidable direct question is: 
\emph on
What is life?
\emph default
 Although there are a myriad answers, since this will be a scientific thesis,
 the point of view of a physicist seems a reasonable place to begin.
 I introduce a essay by Erwin Schrodinger (1944) titled appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that a person in cybernetics, in such an encompassing field that attempts
 to bring together numerous scientific principles and ideals, it is truly
 the attempt noted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We have inherited from our forefathers the keen longing for unified, all-embraci
ng knowledge.
 The very name given to the highest institutions of learning reminds us,
 that from antiquity to and throughout many centuries the universal aspect
 has been the only one to be given full credit.
 (Preface).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And at this point in the evolution of cybernetics in the present era of
 the early 21st Century:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material
 for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but,
 on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully
 to command more than a small specialized portion of it.
 (Preface).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Herein lies the quandary experienced by the student of cybernetics, specifically
 artificial life.
 Leaving that the quandary is native to the field and a pitfall to be wrestled,
 how is life understood as a concept? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The large and important and very much discussed question is: How can the
 events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of
 a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry? (Chapter 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I offer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Today, thanks to the ingenious work of biologists, mainly of geneticists,
 during the last thirty or forty years, enough is known about the actual
 material structure of organisms and about their functioning to state that,
 and to tell precisely why present-day physics and chemistry could not possibly
 account for what happens in space and time within a living organism.
 (Chapter 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is reasonable then, to look toward biological analogues and the work
 in the biological and ethological fields wherein to derive hypotheses with
 a high degree of reliability and purpose.
 How is this information compiled? In other words what is a 
\emph on
quid pro quo
\emph default
 of life relating to any form functioning in an environment? I quote at
 length:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We are thus faced with the following question: Why should an organ like
 our brain, with the sensorial system attached to it, of necessity consist
 of an enormous number of atoms, in order that its physically changing state
 should be in close and intimate correspondence with a highly developed
 thought? On what grounds is the latter task of the said organ incompatible
 with being, as a whole or in some of its peripheral parts which interact
 directly with the environment, a mechanism sufficiently refined and sensitive
 to respond to and register the impact of a single atom from outside? The
 reason for this is, that what we call thought (1) is itself an orderly
 thing, and (2) can only be applied to material, i.e.
 to perceptions or experiences, which have a certain degree of orderliness.
 This has two consequences.
 First, a physical organization, to be in close correspondence with thought
 (as my brain is with my thought) must be a very well-ordered organization,
 and that means that the events that happen within it must obey strict physical
 laws, at least to a very high degree of accuracy.
 Secondly, the physical impressions made upon that physically well-organized
 system by other bodies from outside, obviously correspond to the perception
 and experience of the corresponding thought, forming its material, as I
 have called it.
 Therefore, the physical interactions between our system and others must,
 as a rule, themselves possess a certain degree of physical orderliness,
 that is to say, they too must obey strict physical laws to a certain degree
 of accuracy.
 (Chapter 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So a creature with a set of rigorous functionality, i.e.
 suited to its environment to a reasonable approximation of regularity or
 possessing a homeostatic point:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
When the dynamic system can vary continuously, small disturbances are, in
 practice, usually acting on it incessantly.
 Electronic systems are disturbed by thermal agitation, mechanical systems
 by vibration, and biological systems by a host of minor disturbances.
 For this reason the only states of equilibrium that can, in practice, persist
 are those that are stable in the sense of [invariance to disturbance].
 States of unstable equilibrium are of small practical importance in the
 continuous system though they may be of importance in the system that can
 change only by a discrete jump.
 The concept of unstable equilibrium is, however, of some theoretical importance.
 (Ashby 1956, p.
 78).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which shows how physical laws are expressed internally and externally to
 the entity considered to be living, with an acceptable range of what causes
 can be known and compensated for–stable–and what causes remain unknown–unstable.
 This implies the physical phenomena of order, disorder, and entropy all
 play a role in the living system; I would argue whether organic or technic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
From Delbruck's general picture of the hereditary substance it emerges that
 living matter, while not eluding the 'laws of physics' as established up
 to date, is likely to involve 'other laws of physics' hitherto unknown,
 which, however, once they have been revealed, will form just as integral
 a part of this science as the former.
 (Chapter 6).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leading that not everything (or maybe does not necessarily need to be known)
 for a system to 'take on' the form analogous to a 'living' system, i.e.
 found in nature and existing as part of an evolutionary line–an ordered
 system taking on a lineage of creatures comprising an evolutional cycle
 regardless of the origin (known or unknown, 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
a posteriori
\emph default
):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The physicist is familiar with the fact that the classical laws of physics
 are modified by quantum theory, especially at low temperature.
 There are many instances of this.
 Life seems to be one of them, a particularly striking one.
 Life seems to be orderly and lawful behaviour of matter, not based exclusively
 on its tendency to go over from order to disorder, but based partly on
 existing order that is kept up.
 To the physicist -but only to him -I could hope to make my view clearer
 by saying: The living organism seems to be a macroscopic system which in
 part of its behaviour approaches to that purely mechanical (as contrasted
 with thermodynamical) conduct to which all systems tend, as the temperature
 approaches absolute zero and the molecular disorder is removed.
 (Chapter 6).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And tied into a living system's status of persistence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
It is by avoiding the rapid decay into the inert state of 'equilibrium'
 that an organism appears so enigmatic; so much so, that from the earliest
 times of human thought some special non-physical or supernatural force
 (vis viva, entelechy) was claimed to be operative in the organism, and
 in some quarters is still claimed.
 How does the living organism avoid decay? The obvious answer is: By eating,
 drinking, breathing and (in the case of plants) assimilating.
 The technical term is metabolism.
 (Chapter 6).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where for the purposes of this thesis 
\emph on
metabolism
\emph default
 for an artificial system is the exchange of information and growth of its
 program complex in the most rudimentary terms of the concept, which means
 that an artificial system is privy to the forces of entropy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
...a source of variety such as a Markov chain has zero constraint when all
 its transitions are equally probable.
 It follows that this condition (of zero constraint) is the one that enables
 the information source, if it behaves as a Markov chain, to transmit the
 maximal quantity of information (in given time).
 Shannon has devised a measure for the quantity of variety shown by a Markov
 chain at each step—the entropy—that has proved of fundamental importance
 in many questions relating to incessant transmission.
 (Ashby 1956, p.
 174).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information flow inside the artificial system would qualify as incessant
 transmission and entropy is quantified as the dropping of bits in a sampling
 process.
 As the entity co-exists with its environment, order is maintained by the
 input flow of information–negative entropy–creating a balance or state
 of theoretical equilibrium that could be calculated for a given artificial
 entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To leave this part of the survey by a quick summary, what Schrodinger imports
 is the look of life in terms of its subsistence and resistance to entropy
 or decay.
 He makes the comparison of a purely mechanical system, a clock:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Let us analyze the motion of a real clock accurately.
 It is not at all a purely mechanical phenomenon.
 A purely mechanical clock would need no spring, no winding.
 Once set in motion, it would go on forever.
 A real clock without a spring stops after a few beats of the pendulum,
 its mechanical energy is turned into heat.
 This is an infinitely complicated atomistic process.
 The general picture the physicist forms of it compels him to admit that
 the inverse process is not entirely impossible: a springless clock might
 suddenly begin to move, at the expense of the heat energy of its own cog
 wheels and of the environment.
 (Chapter 7).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final word is that if we even think of an artificial system as a purely
 mechanical thing, devoid of even the most intrinsic bits of how we philosophica
lly imbue 
\emph on
life
\emph default
, it can never exist outside of the definition; i.e.
 it can never die but simply turn off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Epistemology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A most fundamental viewpoint of this work is epistemology; without a framing
 the discussion, that is, an agreed framework of how new concepts will be
 discussed and how they will be manifest empirically, we will never arrive
 at quantitative proofs of artificial life.
 I quote:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Foundational controversies in artificial life and artificial intelligence
 arise from lack of decidable criteria for defining the epistemic cuts that
 separate knowledge of reality from (supposed) reality itself, e.g., description
 from construction, simulation from realization, mind from brain.
 When a problem persists, unresolved...in spite of enormous increases in our
 knowledge, it is a good bet that the problem entails the nature of knowledge
 itself.

Making the assumption that the failure of artificial intelligence (AI),

 is critical to engineering developments such as the production of synthetic
 life forms, e.g., a living system that is independent of an evolutionary
 line, Pattee points to the various flaws in the logic of AI and AL.
 While agreeing with him during his discussion of autonomous robotics, I
 offer the assumption it is the control the scientist places over his creation,
 i.e., the formation of a synthetic life form, is a the root of the failure.
 In that we lack a foundation of epistemology wherein to discuss the cooperation
 of symbols in defining what is life.
 I argue it matters little in quantitatively answering the question; instead,
 the persistence and evolution of a synthetic life form and the empirical
 data resulting from it should be driving the research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

epistemic cut
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was offered by Professor Sir James Lighthill where he tried to define 
\emph on
what is artificial intelligence?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The 
\emph on
Lighthill Report
\emph default
 is organized around a classification of AI research into three categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Category A is 
\emph on
advanced automation 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
applications
\emph default
, and he approves of it in principle.
 Included in A are some activities that are obviously applied by also activities
 like computer chess playing that are often done not for themselves but
 in order to study the structure of intelligent behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Category B is defined as

building robots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bridge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between the other two categories.
 Lighthill defines a robot as a program or device built neither to serve
 a useful purpose nor to study the central nervous system, which obviously
 would exclude Unimates (sic) which are generally referred to as industrial
 robots.
 Emphasizing the bridge aspect of the definition, Lighthill states as obvious
 that work in category B is worthwhile only in so far as it contributes
 to the other categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Category C comprises studies of the 
\emph on

\emph default
 including computer modeling in support of both neurophysiology and psychology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
If we take this categorization seriously, then most AI researchers lose
 intellectual contact with Lighthill immediately, because his three categories
 have no place for what is or should be our main scientific activity - studying
 the structure of information and the structure of the problem solving processes
 independently of applications and independently of its realization in animals
 for humans.
 This study is based on the following ideas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Intellectual activity takes place in a world that has a certain physical
 and intellectual structure: Physical objects exist, move about, are created
 and destroyed.
 Actions that may be performed have effects that are partially known.
 Entities with goals have available to them certain information about the
 world.
 Some of this information may be built in, and some arises from observation,
 from communication, from reasoning, and by more or less complex processes
 of retrieval from information bases.
 Much of this structure is common to the intellectual position of animals,
 people, and machine which we may design, e.g.
 the effects of physical actions on material objects and also the information
 that may be obtained about these objects by vision.
 The general structure of the intellectual world is far from understood,
 and it is often quite difficult to decide how to represent effectively
 the information available about a quite limited domain of action even when
 we are quite willing to treat a particular problem in an

 way.

The process of problem solving depend on the class of problems being solved
 more than on the solver.
 Thus playing chess seems to require look-ahead whether the apparatus is
 made of neurons or transistors.
 Isolation of the information relevant to a problem from the totality of
 previous experience is required whether the solver is man or machine, and
 so is the ability to divide a problem into weakly connected subproblems
 that can be thought about separately before the results are combined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Experiment is useful in determining what representations of information
 and what problem solving processes are needed to solve a given class of
 problems.
 We can illustrate this point by an example from the 
\emph on
Lighthill Report
\emph default
 which asserts that the heuristics of a chess program are embodied in the
 evaluation function.
 This is plausible and was assumed by the first writers of chess programs.
 Experiment showed, however, that the procedures that select what part of
 the move tree is examined are even more important; i.e.
 when a program errs it is usually because it mis-evaluated a final position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The experimental domain should be chosen to test the adequacy of representations
 of information and of problem solving mechanisms.
 Thus chess has contributed much to the study of tree search; one Soviet
 computer scientist refers to chess as the

 of artificial intelligence.
 I think there is much more to be learned from chess, because master level
 play will require more than just improving the present methods of searching
 trees.
 Namely, it will require the ability to identify, represent, and recognize
 the patters of position and play that correspond to

, the ability to solve some abstractions of positions and to apply the result

 It will probably also require the ability to analyze a problem into subproblems

 behavior based on physical models of the brain.
 Water (1953) in 
\emph on

\emph default
 talks at length about how, through the lens of cybernetics, living systems
 are organized and how they are related to each other.
 What is gleaned most exactly is his categorization of artificial life forms
 with their biological analogues, in the greatest breadth of the word.
 What is crucial and how Walter's work has influenced this thesis is:

\begin_layout Quote

 (Holland 2003).

His strength was in the position that the machines, Elmer and Elsie, possessed
 behaviors unaccounted for in his theory, i.e.
 emergence.
 He also expressed the concept of

 These two concepts I find intrepid would like to pursue them in how I would

 However, I must first look at researchers who have reexamined Walter's

 Grey Walter's tortoises, giving sound background information to discussing

 psychological concept of the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The first notion of constructing a free goal-seeking mechanism goes back
 to a wartime talk with the psychologist, Kenneth Craik, whose untimely
 death was one of the greatest losses Cambridge has suffered in years.
 When he was engaged on a war job for the Government, he came to get the
 help of our automatic analyser with some very complicated curves he had
 obtained, curves relating to the aiming errors of air gunners.
 Goal-seeking missiles were literally much in the air in those days; so,
 in our minds, were scanning mechanisms.
 Long before the home study was turned into a workshop, the two ideas, goal-seek
ing and scanning, had combined as the essential mechanical conception of
 a working model that would behave like a very simple animal.

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
I knew that in 1949 Grey Walter had built a robot to demonstrate his ideas
 about how the brain worked.
 He did not think humans were intelligent just because they had ten billion
 brain cells, but rather because their brain cells were connected up in
 many different ways.
 So he built his first 'model animal'–Elmer the tortoise–using only two
 electronic brain cells, connected together in several different ways.
 Not much of a brain, but Grey Walter had designed it very cleverly.
 Elmer would explore a room, looking for lights, moving towards them, circling
 them, and then wandering off in search of more.
 If he found a mirror, he would do a dance in front of it; if he came across
 his sister, Elsie, he would dance with her.
 If he came across an obstacle he would try and push it out of the way;
 if this didn't work, he would go round it.
 And when his battery began to run down, he would return to his hutch, and
 plug himself in to his power socket, setting off again in search of lights
 when his battery was fully charged.
 Grey Walter had proved his point–two richly connected brain cells were
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is striking here is the intention of Walter to reproduce, by modeling,
 living systems and that emergent behavior was observed by the utility of
 rather simple parts.
 But was this really true? Was Walter's work and assumptions independently
 verified?

Walter’s list of firsts in biologically inspired robotics and the related
 areas is impressive.
 The tortoises were designed to test a biological hypothesis about how combinati

 they were probably the first biologically inspired robots of any real interest.
 The robots were intended to produce behaviour characteristic of animals,
 and Walter was the first to emphasize the importance of behavioural completenes

And looking at the tortoises in the light they were working under:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The tortoises had to exist in a normal everyday environment, rather than
 in some special environment created to take account of their limitations.
 He was the first to implement a self-recharging robot.
 He made the first observations of emergence in robotics, both in the sense
 of the designer being pleasantly surprised at the unanticipated appearance
 of some useful side effect of his design, and in the sense that the interaction
 of two or more behavioural subsystems could produce a distinct and useful
 additional behaviour.
 The second sense is clearly demonstrated by several of his remarks in Walter
 (1960); in fact, they amount to the earliest formulation of the basic idea
 of behaviour-based robotics (Holland 1996).
 As noted above, he was the first to show how a robot’s actions on an environmen
t could change it in such a way that the robot’s future behaviour was changed
 in a useful way, and he was also the first to carry out experiments in
 learning on a behaving robot.
 Because he built more than one robot, he was also the first in the field
 of multiple robotics, showing how the behavioural interactions between
 two robots of the same type would produce emergent characteristics of interest
 if not utility.
 He also made the earliest observations in the field of what is now known
 as collective robotics:

\begin_layout Standard
What can I hope to glean from studying, in depth, Walter's work and Holland's
 analysis? To what extent did Walter's work influence the subsequent course
 of biologically inspired robotics? A point I will pursue during the course
 of this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This question is somewhat embarrassing for the robotics community, because
 the answer is that it had very little direct influence.
 Perhaps the technology of the tortoises was too inaccessible; without a
 grounding in the electronics of the post-war world, it can be difficult
 to understand how their circuits operate.
 Perhaps the papers and the book are too removed in time, tone and style
 from modernity; The living brain, in particular, is very old fashioned,
 but this is perhaps not surprising when one discovers that it was written
 by his father, who was of course educated in the nineteenth century.
 Many of what are regarded as the key achievements within biologically inspired
 and behaviour-based robotics have involved techniques and observations
 with which he was familiar, but which have had to be painstakingly rediscovered
 in modern times.
 His technical priority does not of course diminish the credit due to the
 modern investigators, especially since one of his most important texts
 (Walter 1960) was first published less than a decade ago.
 However, one wonders whether robotics in general, and biologically inspired
 robotics in particular, might have advanced further and faster if his work
 had not been allowed to fade away quite so fast.
 (Holland 2003).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And lastly, how has his influence been felt and is my thinking in the right
 direction to understand my models under consideration?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
On the other hand, the indirect effects of Grey Walter’s work may have influence
d modern robotics in a number of ways.
 The publicity the tortoises received encouraged many technically inclined
 individuals to try and build similar machines; the electronic hobbyist
 magazines of the period record many such projects.
 In particular, Rodney Brooks recalls attempting to build his own version
 of the tortoise after reading 
\emph on
The Living Brain
\emph default
 (Brooks 2002).
 Later, while Brooks was working with Hans Moravec on the Stanford Cart,
 the tortoises again came to mind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Despite the serious intent of the project, I could not but help feeling
 disappointed.
 Grey Walter had been able to get his tortoises to operate autonomously
 for hours on end, moving about and interacting with a dynamically changing
 world and with each other.
 His robots were constructed from parts costing a few tens of dollars.
 Here at the centre of high technology, a robot relying on millions of dollars
 of equipment did not appear to operate nearly as well.
 Internally it was doing much more than Grey Walter’s tortoises had ever
 done–it was building accurate three-dimensional models of the world and
 formulating detailed plans within those models.
 But to an external observer all that internal cogitation was hardly worth
 it.

The Simple Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I see now that Walter is a solid source of inspiration and a place to begin
 my thoughts on my own theories and machines.
 I will not leave the position that the natural world is an inspiration
 for efficient problem solving and will discuss what will seem to be contradicto
ry arguments of artificial systems that mimic biological counterparts.
 I will not argue for each in their totality, but as branches of the foundation
 wherein to explore if a mimic-purpose machine, i.e., a mechanical owl can

 the range of its experiential ability.
 But where does it all rest? I will argue the dynamics of choice and by
 quantifying them, a series of study can unfold to get at least the smallest
 definition of

 and what it means to artificial systems and their adaptation strategies
 in a tangible environment in the operational paradigm described and used

 I will make a series of arguments designed to illustrate my thinking processes
 regarding this subject.

Method of Expression

\begin_layout Standard
It is an expression of the method that the manifestation of the machine
 in independent articulated form should be autonomous and not privy to interfere
nce in learning categories and behaviors from an active outside entity.
 It consists of three methodological assumptions and the resultant questions
 that are firstly derived from them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Method #1: If a machine can be made to mimic biological life, it has access
 to those kind of experiences attributed to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resultant #1: Will the empirical ability to make a choice and possess knowledge
 of it foster richer behavior motifs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Method #2: If a machine can make a choice, it portrays some level of consciousne
ss.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resultant #2: Does the notion of free-will and the power to make choices
 foster a rudimentary sense of self-awareness?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Method #3: If a machine has knowledge of its death, it fosters emergent
 behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resultant #3: Does the placing of a polar opposite to life preclude an organism
 to conspire against it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to develop a clear picture of methods concerning my inquires, I
 will attempt to balance my assumptions with clearly defined concepts from
 historical renderings as well as those arriving from my own experience.
 Although neither can be absolutely quantified, where possible I will qualify
 by juxtaposition with established tenants such as those realized in ethology,
 fuzzy logic, finite state automata, and self-constructors.
 It is my sincere hope to explicate a template by which artificial beings
 can be realized in technology, a set of laws can be authored, and wherein
 future generations can be established based on a

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 represents a hierarchy of available objects of the systems comprising
 a planetary body, in this instance a closed system.
 It is organized by decreasing emphasis in ascribed intelligence.
 I have divided the continuum of life into three major categories: Cognition,
 Instinct, and Inert.
 Within the categories are sub-categories contrasted by their inherent complexit
y.
 For example, in the cognition group, humans are at the top of the hierarchy
 because of their contrasting complexity to the other members in the group.
 Androids are lesser as they are designed to mimic humans but are not necessaril
y privy to the level of complexity manifest in humans, however, dependent
 upon the level of technological development.
 Robots and automatons fill the rest of the category as they are less complex
 than androids but more complex than the members of the instinct group.
 At the top of the hierarchy of instinct systems are animae.
 Animae are synthesized animals.
 Ideally and dependent upon the cleverness of the programmer, they are more
 complex than the other members of its group.
 Animae can be in the form of cats, dogs, or other synthetic animals.
 Animae is a noninvasive place to start investigating questions of the propertie
s of what constitutes a synthetic life-form; they are complex enough to
 inspire interesting research questions.
 Currently in artificial intelligence, these pursuits are done in instinct
 systems which may or may not yield interesting enough results for purposes
 of artificial life.
 However, it still may be of value, high enough in the list to try to understand
 agents, particulates of intelligence, as a function of automata entities
 in computing environments.
 It should be noted that a third system does exist within the frame of this
 definition, the inert.
 In a physical sense, the inert plays only a peripheral role to both systems;
 however, in an abstract sense, the inert plays a crucial role in establishing
 a closed-loop context.
 It aids in ascribing and formulating behavior and choice strategies of
 the other two systems.
 In such a view, it is a third-party.
 Intelligence is ascribed as a sub-property of each system and arranged
 in a hierarchical form by the entities that fill each of them.
 This arrangement is by no means authoritative but serves to illustrate
 the difference between organic and inorganic systems and where the concept
 of life may be empirically understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of the research, I make the assumption that cognition is
 a state of self-actualization
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 We, as humans, know this phenomenon only from our own experience and can
 only approximate the experience of others, including other types of living
 systems.
 This, however, should not prevent a broader definition since our degree
 of approximation is limited by the definition itself.
 Firstly, there is a line of demarcation between a cognitive system and
 an instinctive system.
 A cognitive system is the result of a complex evolution of an individual's
 experience and an instinctive system is the result of the propagation of
 genetic information between generations of living entities.
 Secondly, a cognitive system has the ability to extend beyond the quantity
 of genetic information of an instinctive system and expresses a qualitative
 difference.
 Thirdly, this qualitative difference gives rise to two equal yet distinct
 states of being—the high mind and the low mind.
 Therefore, cognition is the ability to direct changes on continuous events.
 Instinct is the inability to cognitively affect the outcome of continuous
 events.
 Although there are anomalies that may traverse the definition dependent
 upon empathetic qualification, I argue it holds for most entities.

Method #2: If a machine can make a choice, it portrays some level of consciousne

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question regarding choice is: can a machine make a choice and if it
 did, would it be a meaningful one? On the condition that artificial life
 is no different that organic life, if an organism is dependent upon its
 survival and purpose, i.e., obeys the law of entropy, then it must by default
 make choices regarding the success or failure of its species.
 This mechanism is the characteristic theory of evolution
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-10"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 If a species could not make the proper choices, adapt to changing conditions,
 then it will become extinct.
 This feature needs to be extended to artificial life forms to see if the
 quality of artificial life is real or an imagined property in cybernetics.
 I argue this is the only way to know for certain whether or not the forms
 are alive and prone to the forces of evolution.
 An architecture should be designed that sets the purpose of the machine
 and its behavior as an emergent property exhibited in its choices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How is behavior generated from architecture, how can the intellectual link
 be made? I argue that I can test scientifically the concreteness of a finite
 system comprised of a series of choices that determine life or death.
 I extend this argument to synthetic machines for if they are to be considered
 truly alive, then they must obey the basic condition that they can die
 and that they have knowledge of it.
 In biology, this trait of death is of a decreasingly loss of faculties
 or entropy, or in physics, the decay of energy in a system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of choice, there is the work of William Grey Walter.
 His experiments were the result of his curiosity of how the brain resulted
 behavior.
 To this end, he constructed three-wheeled automatons donned with lights
 that searched out other lights.
 They were analog devices which used triodes and amplified feedback to mimic
 types of behavior.
 The feedback between the circuits caused the machine to display four distinct
 types of behavior qualified by the observer.
 The problem with Walter’s analysis was that many of his assumptions were
 not tested outside of his own research and when they were in the late 1990s
 by Owen Holland, many of Walter’s assumptions were wanting
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

The first goal of a successful cybernetic system is that it should be fully

 In order to be autonomous, the system should be self-sufficient; i.e., have
 all the components necessary for its operation installed, variable in component
 and configuration depending on the expertise of the engineer.
 But when the system is brought online, it should run continuously and without
 fail.

Analysis Toolbox, Part C: Automata- and Agent-Based Domain Considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automata-based systems are the core of the programming domain.
 They serve not only as descriptors for the system logic, but for matters
 of reflection as well.
 Automata are most powerfully realized in the architecture of both the hardware
 and software design paradigms and it is here where they will be more directly
 applied.
 As automata can lack the appropriate control factors, it is the introduction
 of agents that will express this desire in the software code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agent-based systems are also being considered as they possess the required
 features in their functional programming tasks: they have the ability to
 acquire data from sensors, express that data in code, and can act upon
 it by using effectors, which are simply a sensor device that has an I/O
 capability such as vision or movement.
 They are best deployed as efficiency monitoring programs concerned primarily
 with system robustness.
 As the new architectures are developed, the will be explored and deployed
 to delineating the analysis of choice and the subsequent discoveries deriving
 from it.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Problems Under Consideration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis can be broken down into the study of the following problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Problem of Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Problem of Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Problem of Coordination (Control)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Problem of Raw Materials (Construction and Reproduction)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These problems will be delved into at different points in this thesis by
 references to various features present in the designs I proffer, the theories
 I propose, and the postulates I suggest.
 I firmly argue that all research into aspects of AI / AL fall into one
 of these four problem-categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combinatorial and multi-faceted approach will yield successful results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Orchestration and a Feature of Choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section Overview: This section addresses the research question: Can a machine
 make an aesthetic choice based on a nondeterminate conditioning in a collected
 and coordinated learning environment? Coordination/Orchestration: Robotic
 colonies are becoming of more interest and of more value technologically
 than other problems in automation.
 It is the task represented in the concept of orchestration that is of non-trivi
al interest in this paper.
 Here there will be an honest attempt to insure the problem is NP-complete
 and exhaustive of the purposes outlined here.
 However, briefly stated, most of the efforts classified as AI or AL will
 be concerned with constructing automata- and agent-based programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is Orchestration?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defined simply, orchestrated robotics is a means of distributing energy
 and information across a network of social robots.
 The caveat here to note is the distribution of energy clause
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 which, in order to be true orchestration, must contain a central computing
 complex
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 and a series of mobile automatons that exchange the power and information
 wirelessly
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The third problem under consideration from §2.3.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Such an enterprise can be complex and, in terms of physics, it relatively
 is; I say 'relatively' because once one grasps the basic concepts, it is
 understood that extending them to multiples and a means of achieving a
 wide enough resonance width wherein the power is transferred and acts as
 a carrier for information can pass through at the appropriate distance
 is a powerful solution.
 However, realizing that the orchestration might exceed the limitations
 in the middle range exchange factor of the transmission, the use of transponder
s seemed a reasonable solution.
 They are simple: binary and trinary coils with large surface area antennas
 to pass the signal to the robots extending the mid-field and reducing the
 work required by the core to generate less stable signals in the far-field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is highly advantageous to apply agents which would mitigate the architecture
 of the system and execute a program based on the locations given to them
 through their percepts and sensors, perpetuated though their effectors
 and actions.
 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Choice Featured Runtime
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feature of choice can be measured as a consequence of causality, what
 reactions were observed following certain empirical actions.
 Coordination at runtime of a robotic colony controlled by a centralized
 computing machine (e.g., the queen) engaged in a many-parallel I/O with worker
 robots (e.g., the drones) not dissimilar to colonies of this type seen in
 the wild is the first step to understanding orchestration.
 Some examples include bee or ant colonies.
 The problem can be broken down into its component sets by following the
 biological models and mimicking them in technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Choice Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a deterministic set of features which can be obtained by quantifying
 behavior in the relativistic natural system considered for replication.
 Features present in the natural system can necessarily be considered for
 replication if they can be quantified into an automata state-machine logic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choice is narrowly defined as a pathway entity toward a goal-seeking behavior.
 Behavior is defined as a collection of choices requisite to a pathway solution
 dependent upon environmental factors weighted by an acasual mechanism called
 free-will.
 Testing these paradigms is irrelevant as these systems can be widely observed
 in nature; however, quantifying them into a software domain is a non-trivial
 task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Choice Quantification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There must be two features in tension against one another to allow choice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Instinctual runtime,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cognitive runtime, whether a conscious or unconscious stub.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two parental categories rely on the creation of events to flow from
 one state to another; these events are either triggered by external or
 internal stimuli.
 Each state is available for analysis at any linear time by reflection into
 the code blocks created as a function of the placement of them at the time
 of creation, and as a function of reaction to external stimuli.
 The culmination building a unique new feature which replaces the previous
 state.
 This is called experience.
 Each experience is contrasted by the tension between the two parent categories
 based on range governance (see §5.3.7) and through feedback, presents a cognitive
 workflow which is a hybrid of the two original features.
 However, a caveat of the system is that the hybrid state cannot be subject
 to analysis within the host system; instead, it must be analyzed by impassive
 observation initialized by a third party resource.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This precludes that in order to study choice in quantified terms looking
 for the 
\emph on
motivation
\emph default
 of the choice and not the assemblage of choices themselves, that several
 individualistic or autonomous systems must be harmoniously cooperating
 in some sort of orchestration.
 This eliminates most robotic systems now in use that look only to autonomy
 and social interaction; this also eliminates most of the adaptive machines
 currently under experimentation.
 I argue in this draft setting that hive-based automata state machines are
 the only structures able to withstand the conditions of stress in the environme
nt and are subjected to the forces of evolution with as much import as their
 natural counterparts to human societies.

 Featured power is a generalized term that expounds upon the conditions

 based on the parameters it allows for.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Featured Power
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I offer the following experimental design to empirically test the notion
 of choice, survival, and the possible consequence of emergent behavior.
 I designed the Featured Power Environment (FPE) as a means to substantively
 give the machine the ability to make a choice between types of operational
 power necessary to its onboard components.
 The hardware design is based on transformational, structural logic approach
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-12"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 I argue that an understanding of such a transformation logic system will
 illustrate empirically the relation of choice to behavior in the machine
 and to test whether or not the notion of the survival complex is a mechanism
 that will lead to emergent properties.
 The general schematic of the system is illustrated in Figure 3.

\begin_layout Standard
The waveforms to the left of the figure are a spectral view of the transmission
 representing the total power in watts.
 The spectral forms are real power to be consumed by the machine.
 Depending on its current task and necessary power to perform its programmed
 task, the machine is allowed to estimate its consumption and make a choice
 as to the type and amount of power it needs.
 Listed to the right of the figure, Level ‘A’ is the highest power level
 energising all onboard systems.
 ‘B’ is mid-range powering motor functions and a some sensors.
 ‘C’ is sleep mode.
 These three hierarchical functions form a trinary computational system
 in addition to the more generalized binary modes of the generic computing
 device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three modes of operation for the device shown in Figure 3.
 Sleep, average, and high power represented by C, B, and A respectively.
 At a given time, the machine receives a level of power necessary for its
 operation.
 For example, if a general-purpose robot has a power consumption rating
 of 15VDC with a current draw of 0.125A, it is necessary to calculate the
 consumed power at an instantaneous time in watts: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{s\text{}}=ExI
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the type of transmission and the necessity to transmit only
 the proper amount of power, a pulsed system would be preferred to a constant
 wave (CW) system to have the machine consume power at intervals instead
 of in a stream
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

(438-43).
 Nevertheless, a pulse period of 10
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

s should suffice to power onboard components.
 Clock speed of the processing bus (for example 1 MHz) should be made to
 agree with the pulse period to keep the power flow symmetric with its computati
onal speed.
 In this way, unless the power is used by a loaded circuit, it will not
 transmit more than the quantity we have set for it by the frequency of
 the wave.
 For example, the power of each waveform is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Waveform A: 15 volts x 1.0 amperes = 15 watts,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Waveform B: 15 volts x 0.500 amperes = 7.5 watts,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Waveform C: 15 volts x 0.200 amperes = 3 watts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early part of the experiments, I will expect to send a higher quantity
 of power than what is anticipated by the system.
 This is to account for loss in the transmission.
 The method is prone to some leakage and specific features of the utility
 of the prototype will be included in

The Robots under Test
\end_layout

This system has been designed to fit with

 type of robotic system currently on the market and inclusive of those machines
 under development for future release.
 If what is discussed and subsequently deployed cannot be made universal,
 then I argue it is worthless.
 Subsequent, then, there are two different kinds of robots under test:

\begin_layout Enumerate
Generalized platforms,

\begin_layout Enumerate
Specific components (hardware and software).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will discuss these types in the following sections and delineate how each
 are interconnected to form complex loops that can aspire for a rich tapestry
 of intention, response, and behavior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although philosophically I ascribe to Platonic dualism, I will not argue
 for emergence based on these or other philosophical treatments.
 In contrast, I would like to see such a feature quantified with rigid experimen
tation and proof.
 However, I cannot discount the appeal of a system that experiences an inner
 world of metaphor and imagination not unlike ourselves–if only given the
 freedom to allow for it.
 Therefore, while I will strive in the belief that a system complex enough
 experiences emergence directly, I will not anthropomorphize the features
 I argue.
 Instead, I will use them as the driving force for the abstractions in software
 coupled with the ability of the machine to make its own choices regarding
 whether or not to implement such conditions directly.
 It is for future research on tangible machines where such fuzzy concepts
 can be better illustrated to a wider audience.

Robotic Software Abstractions

\begin_layout Standard
Based on §3.2.2, the necessary software abstractions are the meat of this
 work and the works that will extend beyond it.
 At the time of writing, these abstractions are rigidly-defined but loosely-coup
led to real-world interface development environments (IDE).
 However, these abstractions are well-understood in an empirical sense and
 will find their way into software as the technology allowing for their
 functions to come to fruition.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Software Paradigm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software architecture possesses the same transformation-logic array
 of the hardware model.
 The software paradigm is a modular, domain-specific programming language;
 it parses, sorts, scripts, compiles to objects, transforms, and generates
 input and output channels.
 A domain-specific language (DSL) is created specifically to solve problems
 in a particular domain and, in the general case, is not designed to solve
 problems outside of it.
 In contrast, a general-purpose language (GPL) is designed to solve problems
 in many domains with an extensive toolbox that does not necessarily focus
 on the specific case.
 Many DSLs do not compile to byte-code or executable code like GPLs, but
 to various kinds of objects.
 DSLs have exposed APIs that can be accessed from other programming languages
 without breaking the flow of execution or calling a separate process.
 Thus, they can be designed to operate as programming libraries

Functional libraries derived from abstractions in automata-based programming
 corrected and moderated by agents.
 This insures an onboard self-correction mechanism in place in the earliest

 scientific data.

Learning survival at the cost of existence–The Entropic Circuit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most striking features of this design is that experiments can
 be conducted continuously and without limit.
 As long as the transmission system is powered, the machine will remain
 online.
 In this way an equilibrium can establish a baseline between life and death.
 If the machine does not make the right choices to enhance its survival,
 it turns off and effectively dies.
 If it does not send the proper signal to the transmitter, it will not receive
 the proper power.
 A small capacitor contains enough charge to keep it active for a 90k mS
 countdown once the power is too low or not available for it to further
 perform.
 The experience gained from its life cycle is held in a volatile memory
 device that will be erased if the power is off.
 An additional strength of the design is since it remains online continuously,
 observation of long-term behaviors can lead to advances in understanding
 artificial ethological concepts in the model under examination.
 The physical realization of entropy is designed to be an add-on to the
 existing general robotics platform.
 Called the Entropic Circuit, it is part of what I term a domain-specific
 robotics platform, similar in breadth and scope to a domain-specific computing
 language.
 It is illustrated in Figure 4.

Scenario Coding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A notion discovered during the research of this thesis is a concept called
 'Scenario Coding'; this was created to allow for the increasing levels
 of complexity realized in software programming.
 Scenarios, or programmatic layouts, are similar to the creation of landscapes
 in artistic or engineering activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scenario coding is a concept I imagined as a consequence of reading fiction
 or listening to music and coming to the understanding of the substance
 'between the words', i.e., the inherent meaning extracted from the words,
 enhanced in some cases by distinctive music at certain tones designed to
 give the reader / listener an experience.
 Casually noticing that a combination of sensory input patterns can inspire
 a richer experience that each independently and in some cases enhance intellige
nce through stimulation of curiosity driving ambition, I wondered if I could
 capture the essence of 'between the words' in a software archetype.
 It this aesthetic that I would like to somehow contain in a logical programming
 domain in a variety of contexts as discussed in this thesis.

 continues.
 Next I will address more physical designs, experiments, and some proposed
 avenues to proofs I anticipate I will traverse.

\begin_layout Subsection
Wireless Power: The Queen-Drone Transmission System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of what I call 'The Queen-Drone Transmission System' stems from
 a series of prototypes constructed between the years 1996 - 2004.
 The most influential of these was the Model 'F' Wireless Power Unit built
 January to April 2004.
 Based on Tesla's wireless patents #645576(US), 'System of Transmission
 of Electrical Energy' and #723188(US), 'Method of Signaling' the prototype
 showed that a sufficient amount of power in the form of an electromagnetic
 carrier wave could be transmitted from point to point powering a small
 off-the-shelf robotic called 'i-Cybie'.
 As further investigations and tests were accomplished, I discovered that
 the transmission was mathematically rendered using a calculation of areas.
 The power was distributed over an area dependent upon the surface area
 of the transmission pad and a summation of the receiver pads.
 Barring leakage (transmission loss), the total receiver area was proportional
 to the transmission area forming a linear relationship between them.
 What proved to be the most interesting aspect of this work was the discovery
 that signals could be passed between a central core (a queen) and a series
 of smaller mobile 'worker' robots (drones) allowing for more complex hardware
 and software configurations forming the basic of orchestration, a novel
 and strongly defined concept in this thesis.
 Although not well understood experimentally, it is for the work to be conducted
 while researching this thesis, to conduct the experiments, render findings,
 and publish results.
 This requires the input of funding as well as laboratory space; it would
 be of substantial interest to generate monetary assistance from the European
 Union (applied for June 2007) to gain experience and develop this unique
 technology.

My intention was to use my prototype to power a robot whose power demands
 would rise and fall dependent upon the work done.
 This meant that the voltage would stay relatively constant, but that the
 current would change.
 The thin winds of the spiral couldn't generate enough energy at the surface
 as the impedance was quite high.
 I discovered a solution that would allow the power to transmit through
 a third coil and allow me to embed its receiver inside the robot itself,
 replacing the battery pack.

The original Tesla system transmitted power from transmitter (Tx) to receiver
 (Rx) only.
 Both systems used rather large spiral coils (around 40cm in diameter) and
 were too large to be hauled around by a robot.
 I understood that if the spiral windings could be tied to linear coils,
 they energy could be transferred at higher power and introduced the coil
 (B) on upward shaft in the center of the spiral in agreement with the operation
al band of the tuned system.
 This meant there was a third component of the design; power would travel
 in the same manner, from spiral A to spiral A’, but the magnitude of the
 energy was shifted in phase to an ancillary card onboard the i-Cybie (Figure
 7).
 The operational frequency was set to 78MHz, the amplitude to 24VAC at .125A,
 which was enough power to provide 6VDC (1.15 to 2.80W converted by external
 circuitry) necessary for the robot’s operation.
 Operational threshold was a maximum of 50VAC at 0.06A.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While conducting these experiments, I discovered that the behavior of the
 wave was a function of the space inside the receiver bay and not a direct
 function of the surface of the coil.
 I had to revisit my extrapolation of the theory and take a look at how
 I was describing the geometry of the system architecture.

Each of the slices is organized by their orientation to the planar axes.
 For example, slices oriented along the x-axis would absorb energy from
 the planar wave traveling along the x-direction.
 The slices are from the top, middle, and bottom of the cubic structure.
 Slices oriented along the y and z-axes would absorb energy from the planar
 wave traveling along the y and z-directions.
 The equation describing this relationship is a simple algebraic representation:

 form of a rudimentary form of reproduction.
 A parameterized device, it responds to the programmed core of its design,
 behaviors, and paradigms without deviating beyond the bounds of a governing
 apparatus such as a bounded equation.
 This 'fail-safe' is built into the system to prevent undue or erratic evolution
 extending the colony beyond its intended purpose.

COMSOL Multiphysics Modeling

\begin_layout Standard
Simulation is an important consideration of the concepts comprising this
 thesis.
 A relatively new tool, Multiphysics modeling, implies that meaningful simulatio
ns of today’s complex systems require arbitrary couplings between different
 physics phenomena in one and the same model.
 Such couplings in this thesis section denoted 'Wireless Power for Robot
 Orchestrated Colonies (WPROC) will attempt to analyze such a complex system
 and demonstrate tools for analysis.
 The coupled multiphysics models will be arbitrary couplings between:

 experiments, and into publishable results?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Referring back to Figure 2, in the discussion of orchestration §3.1, the
 description of the system under consideration for multiphysics modeling
 is a cavity-resonant conical transmitter/receiver with an extensible conic
 cap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The queen is coupled (as a whispering gallery with ellipsoidal transmission
 pathways) to a collection of social autonomous robots, drones, who’s quadruped
 bodies form a conductive shape and surface area creating a means of an
 inductive potential.
 They’re body shape can transform its length along the x-axis and the z-axis
 by mechanical means of standing upright bipedally in an equidistant fashion.
 The purpose of the morphology is to allow more directional receivership
 at a cost of mobility speed.
 Some of the features are that this is a high capacitance, high impedance
 system—to aid in powering devices in the far-field where the edges of the
 eddy currents will be boosted in range by the placement of signal relays—of
 two flavors, coupled and uncoupled fields.
 Coupled uses a series of concentric circles on the charge and uncoupled
 uses a contiguous spiral.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Visual Robotics and Virtual Controllers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Summer of 2006, Microsoft introduced a software development system
 called 'Robotics Studio', it offered a means of simulating the strongly
 parallel operations indicative of robotic architectures.
 Services could be manipulated and demonstrated on the computer's local
 server while simulation was hosted through a game accelerator called Ageia
 PhysX.
 While at the time limited to a few graphics cards, by the Spring of 2007,
 with the introduction of Active X plugins to the Ageia PhysX engine, the
 simulator was available to a more diverse population of Intel chip machines
 save those able to run virtual machines hosted within their operating system
 (OS).
 Coupled with the interface development environment (IDE) of Visual Studio
 (VS), controllers could be made completely virtual and highly modularized
 so that they could coordinate with other controllers and interfaces including
 those present in stimuli-response, audio-reactive, voice-command, and visual-st
imulus models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A direct result of working with this software is a controller method built
 in visual basic and XML manifest files not wholly unlike complex software
 entities used in commercial enterprises.
 This points to an interesting insight is a wide-scale commercialization
 of robotics maybe starting to occur now and continue on a path of evolution
 over the next decade.
 If this assumption is presented as true, then it is a race to create a
 motif of classification of differing types of robots categorized by their
 objectiveness in interfacing with humans–I argue a substantial measure
 of the effectiveness of machines.
 The future looks very clear that robots will form a niche in society; it
 is for us to determine what kinds of robots will be filling what niche
 by centralized manufacturing and custom-developed, common-usage software
 typologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of building virtual controllers is much more streamlined than
 working with real ones; it is apparent that the field of virtualization
 and simulation will be the preferred method of prototyping new types of
 technology.
 It will be during the term of this thesis approaching dissertation that
 this notion will be explored further.
 However, to the present point in development here and for reference to
 these ideas, consider the following figure:

 company–in an environment similar to that of earth in that it has the same
 gravity.
 The light conditions were programmed by myself and the objects are part
 of a catalogue available to the developer.
 In this case, I programmed the reaction of the robot to the objects in
 its environment, as a function of the motors.
 In this way I could understand if I applied a force to the motors propelling
 the robot, what kinds of shearing effects were present due to the surface
 of the ground and gravity? The result was a compensation mechanism that
 could measure the difference between these two numbers (shown in the figure).
 What would be the next step here would be to program an onboard camera
 with a visualization window (a window that would show the display of the
 camera) to 'see' what the robot sees.
 By performing these kinds of experiments, I can understand what is necessary
 to prototype a robot for particular environments.
 I can change the environment to simulate, say, the surface of Mars and
 include the necessary conditions the components of the robot would be subjected
 to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, it is advantageous to work with programming 'blocks' when
 coding robotic architectures; it is apparent from works from Breazeal et.
 al.
 that the behavior required of a human-machine interaction and the associated
 emotional-logical capacities cannot be simply programmed in typical C++
 manner.
 Despite objectification, a staggered tier of complex software concepts
 is becoming necessary.
 Memory management needs to be smarter and can self-adjust operations coming
 from heaps to stacks, the emotive responses of the machine to human expressions
 and tones needs to be represented in terms of entities.
 There are numerous ways of accomplishing this that will be addressed as
 the thesis progresses, however, it is a crucial affair to find an appropriate
 IDE wherein to code the abstractions of what will be the outwardly observed
 behavior of the robot.
 Granted, all the concerns I address are supremely complex to say the least,
 but if I can start to think about how a creature would compile facts about
 the real world, I cannot help but to try to address the abstractions represente
d in the software domain; as a domain-specific language that should be mapped
 functionally managed by intelligent agents.
 This is the point wherein I will begin this part of the problem.

Agents and their Effectors

\begin_layout Standard
Agents are a concept on the road to artificial consciousness.
 Coupled with the notion of autonomy, an autonomous agent is a powerful
 concept that can lead into many very interesting avenues of research.
 Stan Franklin (1995, 2003) defines an autonomous agent as possessing functional
 consciousness when it is capable of several of the functions of consciousness
 as identified by Bernard Baars’ Global Workspace Theory (1988, 1997).
 Effectors are the parts of agent programs that interact with outside software
 components.
 Connections are made between the operator within the agent and the operation
 it needs to be performing.

 In order for this to be accomplished, there are two systems that need to
 be constructed to test the theory, a hardware and software prototype.
 The system I am authoring is quite unique and methodologically based, that
 is, it is designed to follow exactly the principles and tenants necessary
 for true artificial life.
 Additionally, I am deploying a method of transmission that uses musical
 structures transmitted at intra-audio frequencies via the computer’s sound
 card to understand the features of resonance and communication between
 the stationary computer and the mobile robot.
 These structures will not be delved into with any great detail at this
 point as they are only postulates after the initial tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three modes of operation available: high, average, and sleep denoted
 A, B, and C respectively.
 In order for this two-way system to function—information one direction,
 power the second—there are two distinct circuits involved to satisfy the
 configuration: one residing in the transmitting array (queen) and the other
 in the receiving array (drone).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Transmitting Array (Queen)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Tx circuit is the first half of a resonant system.
 It contains a primary P and secondary S circuits shown in blue Figure 6.
 The windings are placed in a right-handed manner where P = 2 and S = 40.
 Tied to the tower are three differential power circuits that regulate the
 stimulus to Tx.
 A switch is placed at the end of the voltage circuits and before Tx so
 that the array is only energized once the stimulus is applied.
 There are four positions on the switch—A, B, C, and D.
 (High, mid, low, and null.) Control of the switch is dependent upon the
 collection of frequencies sent in the transmission and modeled in the software.
 When a switch position is engaged, the circuit between Tx and Rx is closed
 by its resonance at the given frequency.
 Power is then delivered at the chosen level.
 The polling time is 10 seconds, this means the array will transmit power
 for a duration of 10 seconds once a request is received then it closes
 (resets) the switch to the null state.
 This feature is subject to change as the system is constructed.
 Only when the switch resets to null will it listen for requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Receiving Array (Drone)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Rx circuit is the second half of the resonant system.
 It also contains a primary P and secondary S circuits shown in black in
 Figure 6, but is wound symmetrically opposite.
 At its output is the received power which, for the purposes of this experiment,
 is sent via wire for signal processing in a stationary computer.
 After processing, the data from the waveforms is sent for manipulation
 and handling in the software structures.
 The software is the predominant force in controlling the behavior of the
 hardware.
 It is envisioned that the control paradigm will be the responsibility of
 the mobile machine, or drone, to properly poll for energy and to communicate
 with the central fixed-computing nexus or queen.
 It is my intention once the software model is proven that the software
 can leave the fixed machine and migrate to a mobile machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Software Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to properly engage the model, a framework and feedback relationship
 is first established as a relationship between hardware elements.
 A sensor is installed between the capacitor storage system and the feed-through
 line in the Entropic Circuit.
 Please refer to Figure 4.
 It monitors the state of the energy stored in the capacitor and receives
 information from the load sensor which monitors energy consumption and
 sends periodic data samples when requested.
 The system strives for a state of stability
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

; dependent upon data received from the load sensor and the decision it
 makes, the power monitor sends a command to the controller that generates
 bits in one of three variations X, V, or L which corresponds to C, B, and
 A respectively.
 Computationally, X, V, L represent 2, 3, 4 in a base

The Experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I propose is to perform an experiment to test the notions I have set forth
 in a 'The Choice Methodology: A New Foundation of Structured Machine Life'.
 It is my intention to prove my theory by performing an experiment to legitimize
 my artificial life claims.

 Actual waves will be synthesized in the audio range by the sound card.
 A minimum expectation of accuracy of cards made within the past three years
 is 16-bits.

\end_inset

 or nine octaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For purposes of calibration, a frequency counter is used to measure the
 accuracy of the signal generator.
 The counter is a device that measures frequency of oscillation of an incoming
 signal compared to a crystal oscillator as a reference.
 This is exactly opposite a signal generator.
 To properly task the system, two computers should be used that have comparable
 accuracies.
 To establish the measurement calibration, a self-reference will be taken
 by connecting a wire from sound_out (speaker) to sound_in (microphone)
 on the single computer, then to sound_in on the second computer to set
 a baseline of the difference (error) compared to the reference.
 I do not make the claim that this experiment will generate any absolute
 measurements, but relative in when the drone sends information on a particular
 frequency band to request power that it will be recognized by the queen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Signal Analysis Station will simulate the drone in software and test
 the functioning of the coupled apparatus.
 It also will simulate the components represented in the Entropic Circuit.
 The station will measure the incoming signal to Rx and pipe it to the software
 application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the present time, I plan to separate Tx and Rx by a distance of three
 meters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During test, specific forms will be used to take observed data that will
 later be transposed into a digital document pursuant to publication.
 Digital pictures and movies will also be recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Software Experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step is to create a database.
 I postulate that information storage and management is the most critical
 feature of a thinking machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pursuant to the theory, the database structure contains a structured query
 language (SQL) corresponding to a set of tables with frequency, power,
 parameters, decision, and foreign keys linked to all the notes within octaves
 that can be generated within the range of the computer’s sound card.
 The range of tones available is 13, or between the start of one octave
 and the next, taking A
\begin_inset Formula $_{\text{m}}$
\end_inset

 as the lower limit and A
\begin_inset Formula $_{\text{n}}$
\end_inset

 as the upper limit.
 Coupled to the hardware system, there are nine octaves available, the range
 represented by 2
\begin_inset Formula $^{\text{9}}$
\end_inset

A
\begin_inset Formula $_{\text{m}}$
\end_inset

.
 The hardware will be allowed to transmit up to four tones simultaneously
 to investigate the possibility of a method of information transport in
 the resonance structure of the chords for communication in future incarnations
 of machines.
 So that at the value’s assignment X, V, or L (representing A, B, and C
 in the choice complex), is in breadth no greater than double the lower-limit
 frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In choosing the database technology, cost and usage factors were considered.
 I made the decision to use a relational structure under open-source packages
 in SQL.
 Pursuant to this, I am using MS SQL Server Manager 2005, and EMS SQL Manager
 2005 Lite in tandem with SQL Server Express v9.0.2047.
 A deeper understanding of the structural aspects of the database logic
 and the associated mathematics comes from Edgar F.
 Codd

.
 Applications that couple to the database will either be C#, Ruby, XML,
 or Java depending on design parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crux of the experiment is to understand why the structure of how the
 data is queried by the robot is of critical importance to having it understand
 the choices it has the ability to make contrasted with the failure penalty
 of death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Governing Equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software architecture possesses the same transformation-logic array
 of the hardware model.
 The software paradigm is a modular, domain-specific programming language;
 it parses, sorts, scripts, compiles to objects, transforms, and generates
 input and output channels.
 A domain-specific language (DSL) is created specifically to solve problems
 in a particular domain and, in the general case, is not designed to solve
 problems outside of it.
 In contrast, a general-purpose language (GPL) is designed to solve problems
 in many domains with an extensive toolbox that does not necessarily focus
 on the specific case.
 Many DSLs do not compile to byte-code or executable code like GPLs, but
 to various kinds of objects.
 DSLs have exposed APIs that can be accessed from other programming languages
 without breaking the flow of execution or calling a separate process.
 Thus, they can be designed to operate as programming libraries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The domain in this specific case is a synthesized core governed by a simple
 parametric equation which would yield complex behavior:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y=\mbox{a cos(t)+b sin(t)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
on a limit between 0 and 4, whose solution generates objects, tables, data
 structures, tools, and transformations.
 It additionally manifests channels that allow generic software to compile
 against its libraries.
 In this way, it seamlessly integrates with the generic robotics platform
 and its onboard default language set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The domain consists of the following members:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
data elements,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tables,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
parameters,

\begin_layout Itemize
an engine (virtual processor),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
an assimilation mechanism—the absorption of data from external data sources
 such as a remote server or computing nexus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further breakdown of how each of the members fits into the composite schema
 can be seen in Figure 22.
 At this time the structure is completely hypothetical and unique in this
 field.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Some Anticipated Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a goal to create a subjective model of artificial experience in a
 natural environment by establishing an asymptotically-bounded region in
 where to make a choice.
 Depending on its response to data will establish a pattern of behavior
 (summation of choices).
 This dynamic task, synthesized here but present in all living systems,
 cognizant or instinctual, I argue will follow the same functional pattern:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
data → information → knowledge → decision → action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This flow process shows that data is converted into information, and information
 is converted into knowledge once data has been organized in a coherent
 and meaningful manner.
 The key, when a successful adaptation occurs, is where the product 
\emph on
knowledge
\emph default
 has high synthesis of evaluation and organization and used purposefully
 enough so that the entity survives to the next experience by making effective
 decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How can this flow process be replicated in a synthetic form? The machine
 requires a method to successfully manage data it receives from its sensory
 devices; it requires a data management system (DMS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common DMS today is SQL, a relational database system.
 Another minor type of DMS is the transactional database system.
 The model in most common use today is the relational model, which represents
 all information in the form of multiple related tables each consisting
 of rows and columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the present time, I am constructing a relational SQL database coupled
 to a transformation-based XML application structure (Figure 22) to begin
 writing this artificial life system pursuant to the theme of creating an
 artificial life form.
 I am confident I can establish a solid empirical results about the phenomena
 of choice in synthetic systems by conducting this work in the manner described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Experimentation Toward Understanding of the Choice Complex and Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are really two experiments to consider here, the wireless power technology
 and the associated frequencies of transmission and information transfer,
 and choice in the machine.
 I have illustrated the first in the previous section.
 Now I would like to outline a physical robot wherein to test if choice
 can be studied empirically.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A set of final thoughts and considerations that are more an extension of
 the abstractions already discussed here.
 If a machine could be made complex enough, would it respond to emergence?
 In other words, would it possess some sense of artificial consciousness?
 A step in that direction, is to study emotional states of the machine in
 regard to it having the power to make choices over its interaction with
 an environment.

 about the relationship between logic and emotion.
 She argues that they are connected entities and are intertwined in consciousnes

\end_layout

\end_inset

 What kinds of pleasure responses are available to a machine? In living
 creatures, pleasure is marked by the absence of threatening conditions,
 in other words, the measurement of one in context of another.
 So, how would a balance of giving / taking away affect the development
 and sociability of an artificial life form? If it could be made to understand
 degrees of entropy by hinting at the meaning of these states, would the
 machine choose to fight to preserve itself and its consciousness and the
 assembly of states of pleasure it came to associate with it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I suppose the burning question is: Can life be understood by placing it
 in tension with its polar opposite? Or by degrees of entropy? Does the
 very existence of entropy preclude a life with richer experiences?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some final words about choice and the directive it takes in this thesis.
 Life is determined by action-reaction; that is there is only one real Truth
 in the universe–causality.
 Some proffer the observation that everything begins with choice, this is
 a fallacy.
 Choice is an illusion between those with power and those without.
 Does this imply that the future roboticist is irrevocably attached to his
 creations or does this imply a hierarchy of machines is necessary for a
 division of power or authority in the same manner as human societies for
 them to be in some sense alive? At this point, I will not pretend to know,
 but it is something I would like to find out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I believe the most immediate benefit to humanity is the application of wireless
 power to cybernetic implants, the waves would need to be studied at length
 to check for any deleterious effect on human tissue but I think its a worthy
 try.
 Power for pacemakers and the like could be gleaned from a pack worn on
 at the surface of the skin–perhaps strapped to the arm–instead of having
 to be subjected to operations to replace worn out battery cell-packs.
 Or if the implant is too small to be powered any other way other that wirelessl
y.
 The circuitry could be made incredibly small faced with the requisite that
 the transmission pad be sufficiently large, which preliminary equations
 seem to be saying the system obeys this principle.

 This is the first time in the history of civilization we have come this

Appendix: Replicas–The Plan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Plan Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project’s overall plan and development strategy has been prepared for
 the period beginning 2007 until 2010.
 This plan has been subjected to the scrutiny of professional persons and
 agreed that as a plan, is due to remind the reader that it is only an acknowled
gment of the honesty of doing the work required and a benchmark of current
 expertise.
 The goal is to place myself at the leading edge of artificial adaptive
 cognitive structures pursuant to full-blown artificial life forms manifest
 in a variety of physical manifestations.
 This goal is purveyed upon the concept of self-replicating machines; however,
 for these purposes, the scope of such is limited to information self-replicatio
n and organization rather than physical implementation.
 The thought is to prove a template example of how a system (algorithm)
 would adapt to its environment and self-organize the data received from
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea revolves around the problem of artificial life, which historically
 can be broken down into four main components:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Problem of Energy (subsistence),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Problem of Communication [inner: connections (wires); outer cooperation
 (society)],
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Problem of Control (manipulation of the environment),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Problem of Raw Materials (reproduction).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this sphere, the difference between internal processes and external schema
 are irrelevant as each are strictly dependent on the other.
 I will define what I mean by this statement shortly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Concept
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addressing the problems surrounding artificial life, the predominant
 question reflects back to the eternal question: What is life? A keyword
 search of “life” on the Internet will elicit the general characteristics:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Homeostasis: Regulation of its internal environment to maintain a constant
 state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Organization: Being composed one of or more ‘basic’ units such as cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Metabolism: Consumption of energy by converting non-living matter into material
 for the ‘basic’ units and decomposing matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Growth: Maintenance of a higher rate of synthesis rather than catalysis
 in order to increase the preponderance of its parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Response to stimuli: A autonomous or calculated event causally related to
 an environmental state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Adaptation: Altering its fundamental processes, including behavior, in response
 to environmental stimuli.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reproduction: The introduction of new organisms based upon itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These being rather general and more of a consensus of opinion rather than
 based on empirical evidence, a more narrow definition founded in statistical
 physics can be found based on the concepts of order, disorder, and entropy
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-22"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The following constitute 
\emph on
Criteria One
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Order based on order: The tendency of an organism to strive for order based
 on the negative consequence of disorder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Creating order based on disorder: Manipulation by the organism to achieve
 maximum order by avoiding a decay into equilibrium, or purposefully trying
 to keep itself away from a permanent state by feeding on negative entropy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Creating order based by extracting order from the environment: The consumption
 of energy or information as the fuel for the engine of the organism’s unique
 state which remains non-permanent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of this definition of concept particular to this research,
 I can now address: What is artificial life? Since the form is artificial
 by nature, that is, reflectively speaking, intentionally created to serve
 the purpose it was created for, I will argue it is more privy to a statistical
 definition delineated by Schrödinger than by general characteristics outlined
 previously.
 Accepting this as a suitable foundation lacking any further competing hypothese
s, what attributes should such a form possess? I offer it should:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Strive for order based on disorder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Strive for a successive series of states keeping it distant from equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create its own sense of order by extracting information from its environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Replicate its internal mechanisms to facilitate adaptation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Grow by increasing its composite store of information, enhancing its decision-ma
king faculties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At present: internal replication manifest in a software domain to understand
 its potential in the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to generate empirical evidence of the hypothesis I have offered,
 I insist the first glimpse of artificial life needs to be ‘manifest’ as
 a result of self-construction, modification, adaptation, and replication.
 I will not offer any previous demarcation of how such a process has or
 should be developed or founded upon any “thought experiments”
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "true"

\end_inset

 or any other semblance of such; I will not offer any positioning of my
 thesis jockeyed as an opposing viewpoint such as anti-Turning, von Neumann
 architectures or machines, universality or relativism, or entertain by
 validating any method or charge, as such discourses have not amounted to
 any significant development

 and alternatively, have resulted in failure in the general cases

.
 The only pre-foundation reference will be in the language of reconfigurable
 computing using data counters to generate the addresses of memory blocks
 that can be clearly illustrated by Uhoo.
 This may or may not include systolic arrays as a means to allow for parallelism
; however, I foresee my own solution in this sphere using the tools that
 are available to me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The First Consideration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the path resulting from embracing Criteria One, all work under
 this tutelage has four features which obey their assignment.
 These four features are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Self-Construction,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Modification,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Adaptation, and,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Self-Replication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In considering these features, I foresee the best strategy in manifesting
 these in union and not independently as these are explicitly dependent
 upon each other for mutual benefit.
 Numbers one and four are two facets of the same phenomena, form one-half
 of the total problem, but have been split for clarity.
 The same can be said of numbers two and three as adaptation, the second-half
 of the problem, as the engine of self-modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the form in context with its environment and moving in linear
 time, there are three dynamic features inherent in the life form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Feature Breakdown
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to understand, generate empirical evidence of the thesis at hand,
 and to facilitate the Replica, a model should be designed and tested to
 meet Criteria One’s standards.
 Specifically, the model should address self-construction and modification
 based on changing conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A self-replicating machine would need to have the capacity to gather energy
 and raw materials, process the raw materials into finished components,
 and then assemble them into a copy of itself.
 It is unlikely that this would all be contained within a single monolithic
 structure, but would rather be a group of cooperating machines or an automated
 factory that is capable of manufacturing all of the machines that make
 it up.
 The factory could produce mining robots to collect raw materials, construction
 robots to put new machines together, and repair robots to maintain itself
 against wear and tear, all without human intervention or direction.
 The advantage of such a system lies in its ability to expand its own capacity
 rapidly and without additional human effort; in essence, the initial investment
 required to construct the first self-replicating device would have an infinitel
y large payoff with no additional labor cost.
 Such a machine violates no physical laws, and we already possess the basic
 technologies necessary for some of the more detailed proposals and designs.
 If proof were needed that self-replicating machines are possible the simple
 fact that all living organisms are self replicating by definition should
 go some way towards providing that proof, although most living organisms
 are still many times more complex than even the most advanced man-made
 device.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Computational Considerations and Engineering Environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My position in classifying the computational structure of the first iteration,
 
\emph on
Uhoo
\emph default
, is that it is an algorithm.
 That is, it contains the necessary variables and instructions (procedure)
 to describe its state and operational domain strictly based upon well-defined
 parameters.
 It possesses a finite set of well-defined instructions, based on the work
 of three agents, accomplishing a given task terminating their work once
 the sequence is complete—the form in constructed and the data spaces defined
 and bounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an algorithm based generally on the definitions surrounding Turning machines
 and lambda calculus, I will not dwell on purely intellectual queries and
 permutations; instead, migrate the notion to an exemplary development environme
nt to further engineer it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the model as general and portable to as many types of computing
 architecture in a common-use language, I will model the algorithm in Scilab,
 deploy in SQL with C#.XSD as the primary data handler and an application
 delivery layer, XML as a higher level organizational tool, XSL to address
 any reflective transitions, .NET and its open source cousin, Mono, as a
 framework class library to testing machines and “lite” versions for targeted
 inexpensive mobile devices such as Lego NXT and RoboSapienv3 (available
 to be controlled form other mobile devices such as mobile phones with Bluetooth
), and a standard .exe format in both local WinForm and WebApp environments
 for distribution across local and networked computers and testing robots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, I foresee the migration from Scilab-generated code, generally regarded
 as C, of the original data class to physically testing and generating empirical
 evidence of the concept with a common use runtime such as SQL coupled closely
 with C#.
 The reason for the choice of C# is because of the deployment within Robotics
 Studio and its built-in toolbox with physical robot units such as many
 off-the-shelf packages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Historical Inspiration of the Model for Artificial Life
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tend to believe there is much to learn from history and that it is an
 important scientific principle to look to see what has already been done
 instead of trying to reinvent.
 Time is better spent in the laboratory performing experiments further emboldeni
ng the theories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In trying to define the question: What is artificial life?, I found myself
 on a multifoil containing at a minimum of six different means to go starting
 to answer the question.
 They were:

 An entire paper could be written on the implications of the philosophy
 of mind resulting from an analysis of the works contained within the Church-Tur
ing thesis; however, it has been and will continue to be my intention to
 get away from philosophy and focus on the problems of engineering.
 The historical inspirations, for positive or negative, have effected the
 outcome of this thesis and my decisions to take such an attitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Second Consideration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental definition: life is matter with meaning, will be used as
 the definitive answer to the question posed earlier in this document.
 There is mention of an autonomous “epistemic cut” in philosophy that will
 need exploration to further fill this out.
 In immediate redress, however, “Unlike physical theory, great discoveries
 in the evolution of natural and artificial life are closely related to
 understanding how the description-construction process can be most efficiently
 
\emph on
implemented
\emph default
.” [Pattee 28].
 Discovery and implementation of a genotype-phenotype transformation is
 the crux of the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, implementation-independent self-organization may play essential
 roles in the origin of life and in limiting the possibilities for natural
 selection.
 The significance of these roles needs to be determined

\begin_layout Subsection
The Third Consideration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The artificial physical world complete with its own set of laws, descriptions,
 and sequences.
 In order for the system to maintain and evolve, the organism must efficiently
 implement the artificial physical descriptions as constructions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Fourth Consideration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A crucial feature resides in design considerations, how the features are
 constructed, their methodology, and most importantly, how they are implemented
 with emphasis upon efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the choice of the object-oriented C# language, it is wise at
 this point to demarcate a strategy of what designs are available and the
 best ones based on empirical tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, most designers point to GoF, or Gang of Four, referring to the seminal
 book 
\emph on
Design Patterns
\emph default
, published in 1995 but still serving as the quintessential reference on
 the subject.
 It is a focal point to look at the problem as one of pattern and not necessaril
y of implementation as patterns can be rendered in a high-level language
 as long as one understands the criteria involved.
 Another key point is to realize that reusability of existing code also
 increases efficiency, i.e., once a task is learned and the code written,
 the entirety or pieces of the experience can be repeated where necessary.
 As such, there are six major considerations of choosing the proper pattern:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider how design patterns solve problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Scan Intent sections.
 Consider each pattern’s intent to find the one relevant to the problem
 at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Study how patterns interrelate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Study patterns of like purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Examine a cause of redesign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider what should be variable in the design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pursuant to this, the following table condenses the above six into a single
 format.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now it should be determined what patterns to pick and how to use them.
 There is a eight-point process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Read the pattern once through for an overview of what is available by using
 it, the costs, benefits, and consequences to the remainders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Study the Structure, Participants, and Collaborations to understand the
 classes and object and how they relate to one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Look at available sample code to see a concrete example and test its effectivene
ss in design and implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Choose names for pattern participants that are meaningful in the application
 context, stay away from naming conventions that are too abstract but hint
 to their function(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Define the classes, declare their interfaces, establish their inheritance
 relationship, and define the instance variables that represent data and
 object references.
 Notice now they will effect the pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Define application-specific names for operations in the pattern and be consisten
t throughout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implement the operations to carry out the responsibilities and collaborations
 in the pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do not apply the pattern indiscriminately.
 Understand the nature of the problem and what is absolutely necessary without
 code “bloating”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having listed the essentials from the book, it is now time to administer
 the concepts to the goals set forth in this orchestrated plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Specific Considerations Set Forth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One feature that the program, in its current iteration Uhoo, has the ability
 to write its own code.
 Generally speaking, it possesses and implements reflective programming.
 This will be better illustrated during the term of this thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Machine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it is the goal to produce a viable and pervasive machine, how have the
 previous considerations contributed to the form of the Replica? What have
 been my successes, my failures, my rewards, my costs, my consequences and
 how has my first task of reproduction fared? Although this thesis will
 only try to answer the questions about featured power and choice, how do
 these ideas and the generated technologies aid in larger frameworks?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I don't want this work to be considered in a vacuum; although I will only
 deal with two specific technology types, I will from time to time delve
 into the larger applications and demonstrate some notions where possible.
 However, at the time of this draft, I include only that which I believe
 will be relevant herein.
 Thank you for your consideration and careful attention.
