## The Method of Artificial Systems

A manifesto antithetical to what people believe is artificial intelligence.

### Background

First contemplated in the summer of 1987, it became a M.Phil thesis in 2008. After trying, unsuccessfully to integrate Arthur [Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer)'s treatise on Kant's Critique of Pure [Reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason) as AI Ethics in 2017 because at the time I still believed people with the knowledge know what they are talking about. Which, in looking at not only the present evidence and state-of-the-art, but the constant lying, a rational stance declares this to be mostly untrue. So, here is one answer to: 

`What is artificial life?`

By exploring:

What is this thing called _machine intelligence_?
